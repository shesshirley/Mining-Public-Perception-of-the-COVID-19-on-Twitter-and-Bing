# Mining-Public-Perception-of-the-COVID-19-on-Twitter-and-Bing
The COVID-19 imposed a large public health crisis both in the United States and across the world. It is crucial to understand public attitudes and opinions. Through observing different data related to COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed that people express opinions with different attitudes and topics on different platforms. In the project, we would like to know the different patterns between different platforms. By implementing sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, topic modeling and word embedding, our results show that the sentiment of Twitter has a wider fluctuation than Bing. People usually express their emotion using different words on Bing and Twitter. After extracting the topic, we found that people care about the update of Covid on both Bing and Twitter but also political issues on Twitter.
